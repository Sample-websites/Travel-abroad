            <h2>3. Use a Visitor Visa</h2>
            <p>While a visitor visa doesnâ€™t allow you to work, you can explore job opportunities, network, and even attend interviews. However, you must leave Canada and apply for the necessary work permit once you have secured a job offer.</p>

            <h2>4. Job Offer and LMIA</h2>
            <p>If you receive a job offer, the employer must apply for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to prove that there is no Canadian worker available for the job. Once approved, you can apply for a work permit.</p>
